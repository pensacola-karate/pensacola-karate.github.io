									<h2 class="text-start">Taikyoku Shodan</h2>
									<p class="text-start h3">										
										Taikyoku Shodan is a basic form in Shotokan Karate that helps beginners learn the fundamental aspects of the martial art. This form consists of 20 moves and emphasizes the importance of the Karate maxim, "In Karate, there is no advantage in the first attack". 
										The form includes down blocks (gedan-barai), body lunge punches (chudan oi-tzuki), and forward stances (zenkutsu dachi). Traditionally, "shouts" (Kiai) are performed at movements 8# and 16#.
										During practice, the focus should be on achieving deep, stable, and correct stances, throwing precise and consistent punches at the imaginary aggressor's solar plexus, 
										and maintaining sufficient stance width throughout the kata. Most moves are executed one beat at a time, except for two sequences of three punches where there is only one half-beat between the second and third punches.

									<h2 class="text-start">Heian Shodan</h2>
									<p class="text-start h3">	
										Heian Shodan is the first form in the Heian series and it is made of 21 movements. Very similar to the Taikyoku series, but includes additional techniques such as the vertical hammer-fist 
										strike (kentsui-tate-mawashi-uchi), rising block (age-uke), knife-hand block (shuto-uke), and back-stance (kokutsu-dachi). This form introduces back-stance, and practicioners should focus on differentiating clearly between 
										front and back stance. Heian Shodan also includes several self-defense techniques, such as escaping from a wrist grab and breaking an elbow joint.
										Like Taikyoku, most movements are separated by one beat, except for the half beat between the second and third age-uke and the second and third oi-tsuki.
										Kiai are traditionally performed at movement 9# and 17#.
